# Air-Quality-Analysis-of-Delhi
This project provides a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of air pollution in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world. Using real-world air quality datasets, we explore trends in pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO₂, CO, SO₂, O₃, and NH₃, and analyze how air quality varies over time, seasons, and locations.
